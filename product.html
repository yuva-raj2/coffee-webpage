          Blended coffee is pure.
          If you’re like me, your first experience with coffee was a “Frappuccino” at your friendly neighborhood coffee chain. Though not genuinely reminiscent of any classic Italian espresso beverage, nor any drink within the archetypal “chino” family, the frozen coffee beverage has taken on a life of its own and rightly earns its place in the modern coffee pantheon. 

The blended iced coffee beverage may not resemble any classic Italian coffee drink, but it is somewhat similar to the affogato. Broadly speaking, affogato is ice cream, or gelato with a shot of espresso poured on top. While much more ice cream than coffee, the blend of sweet and bitter that emerges from this sublime flavor marriage (as well as the cold temperature at which it’s enjoyed) is precisely what we’re looking for in a quality blended iced coffee beverage. 

So let’s take a crack at it. To make this blended iced coffee recipe, you’ll first need a blender. Just about any blender will do. You could even make do with an immersion blender, in a pinch, though a conventional blender with carafe and lid will be best. 

For an added challenge, consider smoking your own coffee beans.

The elements of this blended iced coffee recipe are simple: coffee, sugar/sweetener, milk/milk substitute, and ice. Let’s take a quick stab at a basic recipe, and then talk about ways you can tweak it to fit your desired flavor profile. 

    1-1/2 cups ice, cubes or crushed.
    2 shots espresso, or 3/4 cups strong coffee. Use stronger coffee for more coffee flavor or more caffeine. Decaf coffee is an option. 
    3/4 cups of milk or milk substitute. Soy or Oat milk are probably your best bets. 
    3 tbsp of sugar, or alternative sweetener to taste. 

Combine all of these ingredients in your blender and blend. Pour into a cup, add whipped cream if you like, and start sipping. 

This is a simple blended iced coffee recipe, but there are plenty of ways to adjust it and make it your own. This writer prefers this stripped-down version of the classic frappe. It gives you the sweet creamy taste of a milkshake, with no extra flavors to mask the characteristic notes of the espresso or coffee. However, some people will find it plain, or would prefer their coffee to take a backseat when it comes to taste. 

From here, the possibilities are endless. For added flavor, consider adding syrups made for the job. There are dozens of options, including natural extractions of vanilla, green tea, chocolate, pumpkin spice, strawberries and  cream, orange cream, caramel, chai, and many more. You can even make your own flavor additives, using freeze-dried fruit powder, protein powders, nutritional supplements, or blended chocolate candies. 

For those looking to up the creaminess factor, try adding half-and-half instead of milk. You could also choose to replace the milk with ice cream or gelato, for a coffee milkshake experience to die for. For those looking to cut calories, use skim milk or a milk alternative, then replace the sugar with Stevia, Sucralose, Xylitol, or any other alternative sweetener you prefer. 

If you want a cool way to enjoy your coffee, you could always choose to blend espresso or strong iced coffee with ice. This will give you a no-calorie pick-me-up, perfect for a hot day. Left to sit, your blended coffee will turn into…coffee, which can be refrigerated and reheated at a later point in the day. 

As you can see, blended iced coffee drinks are easy to make, and there are plenty of ways to create the perfect flavor profile for your taste. We hope you’ll enjoy blended coffee year round, saving you hundreds of dollars buying the stuff at the coffee shop.

          Nutrition Value of Black Coffee

If you are looking for a drink that is low in calories, fats, and carbohydrates, then black coffee is the perfect drink for you. Simply put, drinking coffee only becomes a cause for concern when you drink it regularly with milk, sugar, cream, etc. With these additives, even a single cup of coffee can contain as many calories as an extra-large slice of cake.
Typically, an 8-ounce cup of black coffee contains:

    Fat – 0%
    Cholesterol – 0%
    Sodium – 0%
    Carbohydrates – 0%
    Sugar – 0%
    Potassium – 4%

As you can see for yourself, black coffee does not provide calories, fats, or cholesterol. However, this does not mean that it is “healthy” or “nutritional”. In fact, black coffee has very low nutritional value besides giving you low amounts of potassium. It’s just that it doesn’t add too many calories.

So, in simple terms, black coffee calories content is very low, which makes it an ideal drink for those who are looking for a regular drink that won’t harm their health. If you want to derive more nutrition from your coffee, then you can do so by choosing to go with different types of coffee drinks such as latte, mocha, cappuccino, and others.
Black Coffee for Weight Loss

Many people, even those who drink black coffee regularly, are unaware that the beverage is a great catalyst for losing weight.

If you want to lose weight because of aesthetic or health reasons, or you just don’t feel good in your own body, it is no secret that diet is an important part of any weight loss journey. You must consume foods and beverages that will help you achieve your goal, and black coffee is one of them.
Below, we discuss black coffee benefits for weight loss:

    Black coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which helps to slow down glucose production in your body. This means that if you drink black coffee after a meal, then your body will produce less glucose and fat cells.
    Black coffee also contains antioxidants, which help in the weight loss process.
    Since black coffee is rich in caffeine, it helps in the stimulation of metabolic activity and increases your energy level, thereby suppressing hunger.

        <h1 style="color:chocolate;font-size:1rem">FILTER COFFEE</h1>
        <img src="./filter.jpeg" alt="./filter.jpeg" target="filter coffee">
        <p>You will need coffee powder to prepare the coffee. My parents travel to South India quite often so they normally pick up coffee powder from there so I always have stock. The taste of the coffee largely depends on the type of ground coffee used.        </p>
       <p>So buy a good brand of filter coffee powder. Keep in mind that the filter coffee powder is different from instant coffee.
        filter coffee powder in a bowl with spoon</p>
        <p>Serve the filter coffee immediately as a single beverage or serve it after tiffin breakfast items like upma, idli, dosa, uttapam or medu vada.</p>
        <h1 style="color:greenyellow;font-size: 1rem">GREEN COFFEE</h1>
        <img src="./green.jpeg" alt="./green.jpeg" target="green coffee">
        <p>Green coffee is unroasted coffee beans from Coffea fruits (Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora). It contains more chlorogenic acid than roasted coffee.</p>
        <p>The chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to have health benefits. It might affect blood vessels so that blood pressure is reduced. It might also affect how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism. Green coffee also contains caffeine, but in lower amounts than regular coffee.</p>
        <p>People take green coffee for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.</p>
        <p>Don't confuse green coffee with other caffeine sources, including coffee, black tea, and green tea. These are not the same.</p>
